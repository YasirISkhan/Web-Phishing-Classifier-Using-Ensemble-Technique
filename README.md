# Web-Phishing-Classifier-Using-Ensemble-Technique

Web Phishing is a popular cyber technique that deceives users by displaying a fake website to the users. We developed a classifier based on Ensemble technique. We have used multiple algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, CatBoost, and XGBoost, to train on the dataset. All of these algorithms perform impressively well on the new data.
